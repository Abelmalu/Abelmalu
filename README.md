 I am a software developer that loves making life easy through coding.I love building projects that can be used in real life. Programming is all about solving problems. If a code does not solve any problem it is not a code, it is just a text that no one wants to read.This is my motto i built everything based on it,so welcome to my Github enjoy you stay!

Skills: Python / Django/Node/ JS / HTML / CSS
